NOTE: The terminology `C/C++ library` does not necessarily imply that
the source code that produced the library was C/C++. Rather it refers to
the standard file format for object files, archives, etc., which is
historically is closely associated with C. Many other languages
(including OCaml) are capable of producing such files, so OBazl uses
e.g. `cc_deps` to refer to such files no matter what language was used
to produce them.

A library is a collection of code units. C/C++ libraries come in several
flavors:

-   *static*: code units are assembled into an *archive* file, whose
    extension (by convention) is `.a`.

-   *dynamic shared*: code units are assembled into a *dynamic shared
    object* (DSO) file. Yes, the terminology conflates two distinct
    concepts. On Linux, these are `.so` files; on MacOS, they are
    `.dylib` files (but MacOS also supports `.so` files).

Rules producing C/C++ libs commonly produce both a '.a' file and one or
more '.so' (or '.dylib') files. In Obazl rules, link *mode* determines
which type of library is used for linking. Possible values:

-   'static': statically link to `.a` file.
-   'dynamic': depending on the OS, link to '.dylib' file (MacOS) or
    '.so' file (Linux or MacOS).
-   'default': equivalent to 'static' on Linux, 'dynamic' on MacOS.
