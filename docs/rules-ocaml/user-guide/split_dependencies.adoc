OCaml file-system modules are built from two kinds of file:
a _structfile_ (usually with a `.ml` extension) and optionally a _sigfile_
(extension `.mli`). OBazl defines a build rule for each: for
structfiles, `ocaml_module`; for sigfiles, `ocaml_signature`.

link:modules#_orphans-and-dyads[Dyadic] file-system modules may be
built using an `ocaml_module` rule alone, or using both an
`ocaml_module` and an `ocaml_signature` rule. In the former case, the
name of the sigfile is passed using the `sig` attribute; in the latter
case, the `sig` attribute will be passed the name of the
`ocaml_signature` target.

This affords fine-grained control over all build paramters. If a
dyadic module is built using just an `ocaml_module` rule, then the
same build options will be used to compile both files. If an
`ocaml_signature` rule is also used, then the structfile and sigfile
may be compiled with different options.

Use of `ocaml_signature` also affords _split dependency graphs_.
Structures and signatures may have their own dependency graphs, so it
is possible to optimize them; for example in some cases sigfiles will
only depend on other sigfiles, and this can be easily expressed with
OBazl. Standard Bazel query facilities can then show the separate
dependency graphs. Optimizing dependency graphs in this way can have
performance implications for builds. Implementations depend on
interfaces, but (pure) interfaces need not depend on implementations.
If interface dependencies are expressed as module dependencies (that
is, dependencies on both a signature and a structure), then changes to
the structfile will trigger recompilation of all modules that
depend on the struct (and hence all modules that depend on those
interfaces), even if they really only depend on its interface. If
interfaces only depend on interfaces, then changes to a
structfile will not trigger a rebuild of interfaces.

The downside of one-rule-per-source-file is that you need one rule per
source file. Many (most?) OCaml build systems support some form of
"dynamic" dependency resolution, so that the user need not bother with
a complete listing of inputs. Genuine dynamic dependency discovery is
disallowed by Bazel, since it is incompatible with Bazel's primary
goal of ensuring replicable ("hermetic") builds. On the other hand,
Bazel does support _configurable_ dependencies - dependencies that are
resolved during the initial analysis phase of a build - but only if
they resolve to resources that were already registered as build
inputs. The classic case is selection of a platform-dependent source
file at build time. The selected file will not be known before
building, but the set of files from which the selection must be made
_will_ be known before the build commences.

Writing one rule per source file is an obvious candidate for
automation. Version 1 of OBazl did not include any tools to handle
this, but version 2 includes one tool to generate `BUILD.bazel` files
from a tree of source files, and another to convert `dune` files to
`BUILD.bazel` files. To assist with ongoing maintenance, it also
includes a batch editing tool that allows developers to script the
editing of `BUILD.bazel` files.

=== Split dependencies

OCaml interface and implementation files for a given module may have very different dependency graphs.

Since OBazl supports separate builds of .ml and .mli files, users can
optimize by listing (as appropriate) only `cmi` deps for an `mli`
file. Note that dep analysis tools like `ocamldeps` and `codept` will
tell you which _modules_ an interface file depends on, but will not
indicate whether the dependency is in fact only on the `.cmi` file; so
this kind of optimization must generally be done by hand.

Since modules depend on sigs, but not the other way around, this means
that signature dep graphs can be built without causing the build of
any modules, and queries can show just the signature dependency graph
of a target.
