== Dependency maintenance

Each target must list all of its direct dependencies. OBazl does not
currently support file globbing for this purpose, so dependencies must
be explicitly enumerated. If you make source code changes that
introduce or eliminate dependencies you must edit the corresponding
build rules accordingly.

This presents a challenge if you are adding OBazl support to existing
projects, since most legacy build systems do not explicitly list
dependencies. For example, Dune analyzes source files to discover
dependencies. The current version of OBazl deliberately eschews this
strategy. [TODO: explain why]

You can use the `ocamldep` (with the `-modules` flag) to list the
(module) dependencies of source files. For example (from link:https://github.com/obazl/dev_obazl/tree/main/demos/rules/ocaml_archive[demos/rules/ocaml_archive]):

```
$ ocamldep -modules rules/ocaml_archive/main.ml
rules/ocaml_archive/main.ml: Core Easy Simple
```

The dependencies listed are modules; its up to you to map the modules
to target labels. In this example, `Core` is an OPAM package whose
label is `@core//:core`, and the other two dependencies are in the
same package, so (by convention) their labels are ":Easy" and
":Simple", respectively.

If you are adding OBazl support to a Dune project, you can derive the
dependecy labels from the `libraries` clause of dune stanzas. Use
`opam list` and `ocamlfind list` to see which dependencies are in the
`@opam//pkg:` namespace.

NOTE: Tooling to analyze source files and automatically generate dependency labels is under development.

Another (and more powerful) tool you can use to analyze dependencies
is link:https://github.com/Octachron/codept[codept].

== Module maintenance

Changes to source files do not affect build logic, _unless_ they
involve dependencies. If you add or remove a dependency, you should
edit the `BUILD.bazel` file accordingly.

**OCaml Dependencies**

Dependencies expressed in the build file that are not in fact used by
the source code do not break the build, but do make it inefficient.
Two tools are available to check OCaml dependencies:

* link:https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/depend.html[ocamldep] the legacy tool; and
* link:https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/codept/[codept], a more powerful dependency solver.

**Runtime Dependencies**

Source files that access the filesystem (e.g. by reading a data file)
may have _runtime dependencies_. These should be listed in the `data`
attribute.

**PPX Dependencies**

PPX extensions may involve file reads; for example,
link:https://github.com/janestreet/ppx_optcomp[ppx_optcomp] supports an
`[@@import` _filename_`]` extension.

== Namespace maintenance

=== Task: add a module to a namespace

Steps:

1. Copy or create the source files - e.g. foo.ml and foo.mli if needed - in the package containing the namespace module.

2. If you package the namespace in an aggregate (`ocaml_archive` or
`ocaml_library`), add the module target to the `deps` attribute of the
aggregate. E.g. `deps = [":_Foo", ...]`. Do not add the interface
target.

3. Add the module source file to the `submodules` attribute of the
`ocaml_ns` rule. E.g. `submodules = ["foo.ml", ...]`. Do not add the
.mli file.

4. Add `ocaml_module` and `ocaml_interface` (if needed) rules. Pass
the namespace module target label using the `ns` attribute.  E.g.

```
ocaml_module(
    name = "_Foo",
    src  = "foo.ml",
    intf = "_Foo.cmi",
    ns   = ":_Mynamespace_ns",
    deps = [ ... ]
)
ocaml_interface(
    name = "_Foo.cmi",
    src  = "foo.mli",
    ns   = ":_Mynamespace_ns",
    deps = [ ... ]
)
```

== Batch Editing

The
link:https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/blob/master/buildozer/README.md[buildozer]
tool makes it easy to batch edit build files. You can:

* add or delete rules
* add, remove, or rename attributes
* add, remove, or change attribute values
* edit `load` statements
* add or remove comments
* apply edits to a filtered selection of build packages/targets
* and much, much more!

Bazel's query facilities
(link:https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/query.html[query],
link:https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/cquery.html[cquery],
link:https://blog.bazel.build/2019/02/15/introducing-aquery.html[aquery]) make
it easy to inspect the build structure of your project, so that you
can decide how to structure your `buildozer` commands.

To ensure that your `buildozer` commands are correct, you can first
use its `print` subcommand to get an idea of how it analyzes your
code. However, `buildozer` does not evaluate build files, it only
works at the syntactic level. To get a better picture of the
structure, you can use Bazel's
link:https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/query.html[query] facility.

Examples:

* Use `buildozer` to print occurances of attribute `opts` for all `ocaml_ns` rules in all packages under `src/`:

```shell
$ buildozer 'print label opts' src/...:%ocaml_ns
rule "//mina/gitfork/src/...:Logproc_lib_ns" has no attribute "opts"
rule "//mina/gitfork/src/...:Interpolator_lib_ns" has no attribute "opts"
...
//mina/gitfork/src/...:Snark_work_lib_ns []
//mina/gitfork/src/...:Pokolog_ns []
...
```

Notice that 1) the output shows the file system path (the command was
run from `$HOME/mina/gitfork`), and 2) it does not show the full
package label. To get a fuller picture, use the query facility:

```shell
$ bazel query 'attr(opts, ".*", kind("ocaml_ns", //src/...:all))'
ocaml_ns rule //src/nonconsensus/unsigned_extended:Unsigned_extended_nonconsensus_ns
ocaml_ns rule //src/nonconsensus/snark_bits:Snark_bits_nonconsensus_ns
...
```


* Remove `opts` attribute from all `ocaml_ns` rules in package
  `//src/lib/transition_frontier`.

```shell
$ buildozer 'remove opts' src/lib/transition_frontier/...:*
```

    To remove it from all packages

```shell
$ buildozer 'remove opts' src/...:%ocaml_ns
```

=== Patching

Buildozer can read its commands from a file. Since commands can be
fine-grained (e.g. applied to a single target in a single package),
`buildozer` can be used to implement a kind of patching facility.

For example, suppose you use a tool to automatically generate your
build files. A typical case would be where you support both Dune and
OBazl builds, and you generate Bazel build files from Dune files.

There may be cases where the generated files need to be tuned in some
manner, such as adding option values like "-w -24", or adding a
dependency that your conversion tool cannot discover. In such cases
you can write a `buildozer` edit command to automated the editing. You
would run the `buildozer` commands every time you update your build
files using the conversion tool.

WARNING:  It turns out that buildozer cannot reliably add an ordered list of attribute values, like `"-w", "-24"`; it insists on sorting them, which puts them in the wrong order. A bug report has been filed.

=== Case study: removing an attribute from rule instances

The initial version of rule `ocaml_ns` included an `opts` attribute
that is not needed. Removing it from the rule entailed editing
existing projects to remove it from instances of the rule. The
link:#buildozer[buildozer] tool makes this easy.

**Step one**: verify that all occurances of `opts` on `ocaml_ns` rules are
empty. This was not strictly necessary, since the rule did not use the
attribute anyway, but we show it for demonstration purposes. The first
query below will print all instances whose `opts` attribute is empty,
or contains a null string, or a string of spaces; the second will
print any instances whose `opts` attribute is not empty:

```shell
$ bazel query 'attr(opts, "\[ *]", kind("ocaml_ns", //src/...:all))' | sort
$ bazel query 'attr(opts, "\[.*[^ ].*\]", kind("ocaml_ns", //src/...:all))' | sort
```

Note that the second argument to the `attr` function is a regular
expression used to match the content of the `opts` attribute; see
link:https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/query.html#attr[attr] for
more information on querying attributes.

**Step two**: remove the attribute:

```shell
$ buildozer 'remove opts' src/...:%ocaml_ns
fixed /Users/gar/mina/gitfork/src/lib/otp_lib/BUILD.bazel
fixed /Users/gar/mina/gitfork/src/lib/pickles/limb_vector/BUILD.bazel
...
```

**Step three**: verify results. Using `buildozer`:

```shell
$ buildozer 'print label opts' src/...:%ocaml_ns | sort
rule "//mina/gitfork/src/...:Non_zero_curve_point_ns" has no attribute "opts"
rule "//mina/gitfork/src/...:Tweedle_ns" has no attribute "opts"
...
```

Using `query`: this is a little bit trickier, since the query facility
looks at rule definitions as well as instances, unlike `buildozer`.
The `attr` function we used above will treat every instance of
`ocaml_ns` as containing an `opts` attribute even if it is not
explicity expressed by the instance code, since it is defined for the
rule and therefore has a default value. So if we run the query we ran
previously after removal of the `opts` attribute from the
`BUILD.bazel` files but before its removal from the rule definition,
we get a list of all the `ocaml_ns` instances. But if we run it after
the rule definition has been changed, then, assuming our remove
command succeeded, it will produce the empty list, verifying our
`buildozer` edit. On the other hand, if an `ocaml_ns` instance has an
`opts` attribute, running the query will throw an exception
complaining that the rule has no `opts` attribute.  So strictly
speaking we do not need to run this query, we can just run a build.

```shell
$ bazel query 'attr(opts, ".*", kind("ocaml_ns", //src/...:all))' | sort
```

 (Note: we changed the regex to match anything, since
we just want to know if the attribute exists.)
