WARNING: Support for C/C++ deps is still under development. What's
  there works but the interface will likely change since there are
  still some issues to be worked out, such as how best to support
  different link modes and options for each CC dependency.

A "CC dependency" is usually a C/C\++ library, but CC dependencies need
not necessarily be produced from C/C++ source code. Rather the term refers
to the standard file format for object files, archives, etc., which is
historically is closely associated with C. Many other languages
(including OCaml, Rust, Go, etc.) are capable of producing such files;
OBazl uses 'CC' terminology (e.g. `CC library`, `cc_deps`) to refer to
such files no matter what language was used to produce them.

* link:#linkmode[CC Linkmode]
* link:#plugins[Dynamic Loading (Plugins)]
* link:#cycles[Dependency Cycles]
* link:#macos[MacOS]


A library is a collection of code units. CC libraries come in
several flavors:

* an unpackaged collection of object files (with `.o` extension)

* a _static_ 'library': a collection of code units (object files)
  packaged as an _archive_ file, whose extension (by convention) is
  `.a`.

* a _dynamic shared_ 'library': code units (object files) packaged as
  a _dynamic shared object_ (DSO) file. Yes, the terminology conflates
  two distinct concepts; OBazl generally treats 'dynamic' and 'shared'
  as synonyms. On Linux, these are `.so` files; on MacOS, they are
  `.dylib` files (but MacOS also supports `.so` files).

=== CC Linkmode

Rules producing CC libs commonly produce both a static archive ('.a'
file) and one or more shared libraries ('.so' or '.dylib' files). In
Obazl rules, _link mode_ determines which type of library is used for
linking. Possible values:

* 'static': statically link to `.a` file.
* 'dynamic': depending on the OS, link to '.dylib' file (MacOS) or '.so' file (Linux or MacOS).
* 'shared': synonym for 'dynamic'
* 'default': by default, equivalent to 'static' on Linux, 'dynamic' on MacOS.

**NOTE** The 'default' linkmode is configurable. The default value
  for linkmode 'default' is as noted above. To override the default
  for all rules, pass command-line option `--@ocaml//linkmode`; for
  example, to set default value for linkmode 'default' to 'dynamic'
  pass `--@ocaml//linkmode:dynamic`.

=== Dynamic Loading ('Plugins')

[TODO: document dynamic loading of CC deps; compare OCaml *.cmxs
files. Distinction between linking and loading.]

=== Static Binaries

Executable binaries can be linked in several ways:

* Dynamic - all deps are shared libs
* Partially static - non-system libs may be statically linked, but system libs are dynamically linked
* Fully static -- all dependencies, including system libraries, are statically linked, resulting in a complete standalone executabe.

**WARNING** MacOS does not support statically linked executables. See link:https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/qa/qa1118/_index.html[Statically linked binaries on Mac OS
  X]

[TODO: flesh this out]

=== Dependency Cycles

Legacy packages may include circular or mutual dependencies. Bazel
disallows such dependencies.

Example: libfqfft/evaluation_domain/domains and libfqfft/polynomial_arithmetic are mutually dependent.

In this case listing each in the deps attribute of the other will
fail, since Bazel will detect the dependency cycle.

The "proper" way to address this is to refactor the packages to
eliminate the cycles.  But we cannot do that with legacy code we do
not control.

The workaround seems to be to use 'include_prefix' ...  This will make
compilation work, at the cost of removing at least one of the
dependencies, so a change in one will not force a recompile of the
other.  [Why does this work?]

=== MacOS

Linking dynamic libs to an executable on MacOS is an open issue. The
workaround for now is to link to static libs.
