A
link:https://bazel.build/rules/config#user-defined-build-settings[user-defined
build setting,window="_blank"], in Bazel's terminology, is a rule that
determines a single piece of configuration information.

A "configuration rule", in OBazl's terminology, is a build setting
rule that is designated as the default value of a rule attribute.

Some OCaml compile options are used so commonly used that they should
probably be the default. Changing compiler defaults would break
existing code, so OBazl does the next best thing: it defines a set of
configuration rules that control the construction of compile commands.
These are documented in the link:/docs_obazl/rules-ocaml/reference[rules_ocaml Reference Manual].

Each configuration rule has a default value, which may be globally
overridden on the command line. For example, verbosity is controlled
by flag `@ocaml//verbose`, which is set to False (disabled) by
default. Each `ocaml_*` rule examines this flag to decide whether or
not to add `-verbose` to the build command; setting it to True tells
OBazl to add `-verbose` to all build commands.

To enable a boolean flag, just pass the flag: `--@ocaml//verbose`, or
equivalently: `--@ocaml//verbose:enable`. To disable, prefix `no` to
the flag: `--no@ocaml//keep-locs`, or equivalently `--@ocaml//keep-locs:disable`.

WARNING: These flags/options apply to rules, and therefore to all
  instances of the rules. This means that changing one of them will
  trigger a rebuild of all direct and indirect dependencies of the
  build target!

Each flag corresponds to an option that can also be passed via the
`opts` rule attribute. For example, `@ocaml//verbose` corresponds to
`-verbose`, `@ocaml//strict-sequence` corresponds to
`-strict-sequence`, and so forth. Usually the correspondance is direct
and obvious; the exception is `@ocaml//cmt`, which corresponds to
flag `-bin-annot`, which tells the compiler to emit `*.cmt/*.cmti` files as
a side-effect of compilation.

Negation is generally a simple matter of omission. If `--@ocaml//foo`
adds flag `-foo`, then `--no@ocaml//foo` (equivalently
`--@ocaml//foo:disable`) will prevent addition of that flag. For
example, the `-short-paths` flag is added to all compile commands by
default, since the default for `@ocaml//short-paths` is True. Setting
the default to false by passing `--no@ocaml//short-paths` (or
`--@ocaml//short-paths:disable`) simply prevents the addition of that
flag.

== Case-by-case overrides

These configuration rules - flags and options - have global effect; each
instance of each `ocaml_*` rule will be controlled by these
flags/options. But they can be overridden on a case-by-case basis by
passing the relevant argument to the `opts` attribute.

For example, verbosity is globally disabled by default. To enable
verbosity for a particular `ocaml_module` instance, just add
`-verbose` to the `opts` attribute of the rule.

=== Disabling

Disabling is just as easy, but does not always correspond directly to
OCaml flags. Some OCaml flags support a negating prefix `-no`; for
example, `ocamlopt --help` displays the following:

```
  -keep-locs  Keep locations in .cmi files (default)
  -no-keep-locs  Do not keep locations in .cmi files
```

But not all flags support negation in this way; for example, there is
no `-no-verbose` flag. However, the OBazel `opts` attribute _does_
understand such flags, which allows negation for such cases. For
example, suppose verbosity has been globally enabled by passing
`--@ocaml//verbose`. To disable verbosity for a particular
`ocaml_module` instance, pass `-no-verbose` to the `opts` attribute.
This tells OBazl (not OCaml) to remove the `-verbose` flag that the
global setting adds.

A `-no` prefixed flag for the `opts` attribute is supported for each
configuration rule, just as `--no@ocaml//<flag>` is supported
for the command-line.

**IMPORTANT** The authoritative source of documentation for OCaml compile
  flags is the compiler `--help` option. At time of writing, the
  official OCaml manual is incomplete (for example, it does not
  document `-keep-locs`).
