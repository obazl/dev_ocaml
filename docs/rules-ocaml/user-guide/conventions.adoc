* `.bazelrc` - always put this file in the project root directory; at
  a minimum, it should contain `+try-import .private/user.bazelrc+`.
+
See link:https://bazel.build/docs/bazelrc[Write bazelrc configuration files,window="_blank"] for more information.

* Use `.private/user.bazelrc` to pass arguments to Bazel. Do not put
  it under version control. Add it to `.gitignore`.

** Use `:name` suffixes to control sets of configuration settings ("profiles") at the command line
    using link:https://bazel.build/docs/bazelrc#config[--config,window="_blank"]


* Put the following in `.gitignore`:

** `.private/` - developers can use this subdirectory for shell scripts,
    data files, etc. that should not be under version control
** `logs/`
** `tmp/`
** `user.bazelrc`

* Use `.bazelignore` to exclude irrelevant subdirectories from Bazel
  processing. For example, if you are adding Bazel support to a
  project that uses Dune, put `_build` in `.bazelignore`.

* `WORKSPACE.bazel`, not `WORKSPACE`

* Explicitly name your workspace - make `workspace(name="foo")` the
    first line of `WORKSPACE.bazel` (replacing `foo` with your
    workspace name). This will make log messages more decipherable,
    among other things.

* Use `WORKSPACE.bzl` for extension code needed by `WORKSPACE.bazel`,
  such as `fetch()` functions that link:bootstrapping.html#fetching-rules-repositories[fetch language rules and external repositories].

* `BUILD.bazel`, not `BUILD`

* Use `BUILD.bzl` for extension code needed by `BUILD.bazel`

* Importing external repositories

** If you import only a small number of repositories, and you do not
    expect others to import your repository, put the importing rules
    (`http_repository`, `git_repository`) in `WORKSPACE.bazel`

** Otherwise, define one or more bootstrapping functions in
    `WORKSPACE.bzl` (note the extension, `.bzl`, not `.bazel`)
    responsible for fetching the repositories. See
    link:bootstrapping[Bootstrapping] for an example. Name them
    `<lang>_fetch_rules` (for fetching language support packages) and
    `<lang>_fetch_repos` for library repositories.

* Mixed projects - using Bazel and another build tool (e.g. Dune) in
  parallel

** If you want to keep Bazel files segregated, create a top-level
    `bzl` directory and keep Bazel extension files etc. there.

* Use a `tools` subdirectory to store shell scripts and any other tools you want under version control.

** Create a shell alias to enable easy access
    to the command log. Put the following (or something similar) in
    `tools/aliases`, and then source the file: `$ source
    tools/aliases`. Then `$ bl` will browse the log using `less`.

```
    alias "bl=less `bazel info command_log`"
```

== Naming Conventions

* Repository fetching functions:

** `<lang>_fetch_rules` - for fetching rules packages
** `<lang>_fetch_repo`, `<lang>_fetch_repos` - for fetching library repositories
** alternative: `<lang>_fetch_lib`, `<lang>_fetch_libs`

* primary target names should match package name. E.g. `//foo/bar:bar`

* `ocaml_module` and `ppx_module` targets should capitalize the
  initial character (i.e. should match the OCaml module name). For
  example, `ocaml_module(name="Foo", src="foo.ml"...)`.

* `ocaml_signature` targets should follow the same convention as for
  modules, suffixed by `_cmi`. For example:
  `ocaml_interface(name="Foo_cmi", src="foo.mli"...)`

* `ocaml_ns_resolver` target names should be suffixed by `_ns`.
