== Cross-module Optimization

The native compiler (with or without Flambda)  enables cross-module optimization by default. The
`-opaque` flag (link:https://v2.ocaml.org/manual/native.html[Chapter
14 Native-code compilation (ocamlopt),window="_blank"] disables it.

NOTE: "Cross-module" optimization means compile-time optimization, not
whole-program link-time optimization.  For example inlining.

The meaning of `-opaque` is different for sigfiles and structfiles:

* "When compiling [an] `.mli` interface, using `-opaque` marks the
  compiled `.cmi` interface so that subsequent compilations of modules
  that depend on it will not rely on the corresponding `.cmx` file, nor
  warn if it is absent."
* "When the native compiler compiles a .ml implementation, using
  `-opaque` generates a `.cmx` that does not contain any cross-module
  optimization information."

In other words, using `-opaque` to compile a `.mli` file makes it act
 like a standalone signature: the compiler will ignore any
 corresponding `.cmx` file, which means the build system should not
 force a rebuild of modules that depend on the `.cmi` file even if the
 corresponding `.ml` file changes.

Similarly, if an `.ml` file is compiled with `-opaque` (and the `.mli`
file is compiled without it), it won't be ignored but it might as well
be with respect to optimization, because its `.cmx` file will not have
any optimization info.

In short, in case the `.ml` changes but the `.mli` does not, and the
latter is compiled with `-opaque`, the `.ml` file should be
recompiled, but this should not force a rebuild of anything that
depends on the module. Remember that "depend on a module" means depend
first on the `.cmi` file of the module, and then on the `.cmx` file.

An example
(link:https://github.com/obazl/demos_obazl/tree/main/rules_ocaml/deps/opaque[deps/opaque,window="blank"]).
We have the following dependency structure:

`test (exe) > Test > Greeting > Hello`

Now suppose we build `hello.mli` with `-opaque`.

If you change `hello.ml` and then build target
`//deps/opaque:Greeting`, nothing will happen - in particular,
`hello.ml` will **_not_** be recompiled. That's because Bazel will only
compile what is needed, and `Greeting` does not _need_ `hello.cmx` -
it does need `hello.cmi`, but that did not change, and because it was
compiled with `-opaque`, it tells the compiler not to bother with
`hello.cmx`.

TIP: Remember that you can build any target at the command line, no
matter what its `visibility` attribute says. That attribute only
governs visibility of dependencies.

However, if we build target `//deps/opaque:test` - the executable - then
`hello.ml` _will_ be compiled, and then the test executable will be
built. But neither `Greeting` nor `Test` will be recompiled.

Something similar but slightly different happens when we compile an
`.ml` file with `-opaque`. In this demo, `Greeting` is an "orphan"
module - it only has `greeting.ml`, without a `greeting.mli`. That
means `greeting.cmi` is dependent on `greeting.ml`, so it will be
regenerated and recompiled whenever `greeting.ml` changes. In this
situation there is no way to tell OCaml to compile _just_ the `.cmi`
file with `-opaque`. So we compile `greeting.ml` with `-opaque`. Then
we can change `greeting.ml` without triggering a recompile of `Test`.
However, building `//deps/opaque:Test` at the command line _will_
recompile `greeting.ml`, even though `Test` does not need it. That's
because `Test` _does_ need `greeting.cmi`, and since `greeting.ml`
changed, it must be recompiled in order to produce `greeting.cmi`. And
again if we build `//deps/opaque:test`, then `greeting.ml` will be
recompiled and `test` will be relinked, but `Test` will not be
recompiled.

TIP: If you run the demo, pass `--subcommands=pretty_print` to see what actually gets done.

Bazel can handle this with relative ease because it makes a
distinction between target dependencies and action dependencies. When
you write your BUILD.bazel file you decide what to list as target
dependencies, but the rule implementation gets to decide what goes
into the action dependency graph. And its the action dependency graph
that determines what gets rebuilt.

When we build without `-opaque`, the `ocaml_module` rule puts all
target dependencies in the (compile) action dependency graph, so
changes will always trigger rebuilds all the way up the dependency
chain. But when `-opaque` is involved, the OBazl ruies can figure out
that the `.cmx` file should _not_ go in the action depencency graph.
Well, not the _compile_ dependency graph. We also have a _link_
dependency graph, and we always include everything in that, but it
only gets added to the graph of executable targets. The OBazl rules
always propagate these graphs up the dependency chain. This is
necessary, because all inputs and outputs for an action must always be
explicitly enumerated. This is a major difference between Bazel and
(many) other build systems that just keep track of directories. That
makes sense insofar as compilers generally accept directories and
search them. But directories are not enough for Bazel.
