====

If your `WORKSPACE.bazel` gets crowded (as may happen if your project
depends on a lot of external repositories), you may want to wrap the
repository rules in a `fetch()` function and put it in an _extension
file_ (a file with extension `.bzl`). The link:obazl-conventions[OBazl
convention] is to put such extension functions in
`WORKSPACE.bzl`.

== Bootstrapping Other Language Rules

=== Fetching Rules Repositories

The link:obazl-conventions[OBazl convention] is to put fetch code in
`WORKSPACE.bzl`, but that is a convention, not a requirement; they can
go in any extension file (with extension `.bzl`).

Define one `*_fetch_rules` function for each language, and call them
from `WORKSPACE.bazel`.

Example:

=== Configuring Language Rules

Most Language Support Packages (LSPs) contain one or more
configuration functions. These must be loaded and executed after the
rules are fetched.  See the LSP documentation for details.
