Most preprocessing tasks can be handled by Bazel's standard `genrule`,
which is designed to run shell scripts. OBazl version 2 adds some new
rules to support standard code generation tools, such as `ocaml_lex`
and `ocaml_yacc`.

== genrule

== ocamllex

== ocamlyacc

== ppx

PPX processing is a little more complicated, and requires some
specialized support. OBazl provides one specialized rule,
`ppx_executable`, and a collection of ppx-specific attributes on
`ocaml_module` and `ocaml_signature` rules, including:

* `ppx` takes the label of a `ppx_executable` target; the executable will be used to preprocess the source file;
* `ppx_args` is used to pass command args to the `ppx_executable`
* `ppx_data` passes data files needed at `ppx_executable` runtime
* `ppx_print` controls the form of PPX processing output, either `binary` or `text`

Some PPX transformers inject dependencies into the sources they
transform. Dune calls these "runtime" dependencies, but this is
inaccurate; they become _compile-time_ dependencies of the files
output by the PPX transformation. OBazl version 1 called these _adjunt
dependencies_, for lack of a better term; version 2 calls them _ppx
co-dependencies_. They are passed to the `ppx_executable` through a
`ppx_codeps` attribute.
