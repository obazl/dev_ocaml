IMPORTANT: Bazel also has link:https://bazel.build/docs/bzlmod#modules[modules,window="_blank"], which must not be confused with OCaml modules.  Bazel modules were introduced after work on OBazl version 2 was well underway so they are not used.  The next version will use Bazel modules.



== OCaml Modules

An OCaml module is a composite formed by pairing a
[signature](#signatures)
and a
[structure](#structures).


IMPORTANT: Compilation of module files _always_ involves separate
compilation of interface and implementation; but as a convenience, the
OCaml compilers support compilation of stand-alone implementation
files. An implicit interface can always be inferred from any
implementation file; when passed a `.ml` file without a corresponding
interface, the compilers will extract the implicity defined interface and
compile it separately before proceding with the implementation
compile. The output of such a compile will thus include a `.cmi` file
in addition to the `.cm[ox]` output.

Compiling modules - that is, compiling and then binding their
interface and implementation files - is straightforward with OBazl. A
stand-alone implementation:

```
ocaml_module(name = "Module1", struct = "module1.ml")
```
With both parts:

```
ocaml_signature(name = "Module1_cmi", src = "module1.mli")
ocaml_module(name = "Module1", struct = "module1.ml", sig=":Module1_cmi")
```

In this example, the `sig` attribute makes the `ocaml_signature`
target a dependency of the `ocaml_module` target, which ensures that
it will be compiled first, producing `module1.cmi`. The `ocaml_module`
target will use that `.cmi` file to govern compilation of `module.ml` -
in effect creating a "module binding" of interface to implementation;
its output will include the compiled implementation file(s) (either
`module1.cmo` or the pair `module1.cmx` and `module1.o` for native
compilation) plus the `.cmi` file.

This design affords great flexibility in module construction. In
particular, it makes it easy to configure module bindings based on
user-defined constraints. A typical use case is the need to select a
platform-specific implementation file for binding to a
platform-independent interface file. No special features or concepts
(e.g. "virtual library") are needed for this; the built-in `select`
function suffices. Here is an example based on code in the OCaml
compiler sources (with some detail omitted):

.asmcomp/BUILD.bazel
```
ocaml_signature(
    name = "Proc_cmi",
    src  = "proc.mli"
)
ocaml_module(
    name   = "Proc",
    struct = select({
        "//config/arch:x86_64": "//asmcomp/amd64:proc.ml",
        ... etc. ...
        "//config/arch:s390x"   : "//asmcomp/s390x:proc.ml",
    }, no_match_error = "unknown arch"),
    sig    = "Proc_cmi"
)
```

The selection constraints are defined in a separate file:

.config/arch/BUILD.bazel
```
config_setting(name = "x86_64",
               constraint_values = ["@platforms//cpu:x86_64"])
... other conf_setting targets omitted ...
config_setting(name = "s390x",
               constraint_values = ["@platforms//cpu:s390x"])
```

In this example, the implementation file will be selected based on the
platform (e.g. `@platforms//cpu:x86_64`); the `ocaml_module` rule will
ensure that the selected file will be compiled using `proc.cmi` as its
interface.
