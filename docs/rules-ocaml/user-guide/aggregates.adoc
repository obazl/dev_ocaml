OBazl makes a clear and firm distinction between the concepts
`library` and `archive`.

A _library_ is just an aggregate - a collection of compiled modules,
interfaces, and possibly other resources, such as data files.
Libraries are expressed in OBazl using the `ocaml_library` rule. A
target using this rule lists its contents in a `manifest` attribute;
the content elements, being expressed as Bazel labels, can be located
anywhere in the project.  An `ocaml_library` may contain
other libraries.

An `ocaml_library` does not execute an action. It does not build
anything; rather, it just collects the dependencies listed in its
`manifest` attribute and delivers them to its clients. Its power lies
in its ability to aggregate any collection of targets from anywhere in
the project workspace. For example, this makes it easy to organize
source code along conceptual lines. Instead of stuffing a lot of files
into a single directory, you can create a hierarchy of directories
where each corresponds to some concept. Each such directory can have
its own `ocaml_library`, which will depend on the `ocaml_library`
targets of whatever other directories it depends on,



An _archive_ is a library packaged as an OCaml archive (`.cma/.cmxa`)
file. Like an `ocaml_library`, an `ocaml_archive` target lists its
contents in a `manifest` attribute, but unlike `ocaml_library` it
executes a build action that constructs an OCaml archive. An
`ocaml_archive` may contain `ocaml_library` targets, but may not contain
other `ocaml_archive` targets.

'''

In contrast to other build systems, and the OCaml community in
general, OBazl makes a distinction between the concepts `library` and
`archive`.

An OBazl _library_ is just an aggregate - a collection of
compiled modules, signatures. An `ocaml_library` target lists its
contents in a `manifest` attribute: it constructs nothing and delivers
its contents as a list in dependency order.

An _archive_ is a library packaged as an OCaml archive (`.cma/.cmxa`)
file. Like an `ocaml_library`, an `ocaml_archive` target lists its
contents in a `manifest` attribute, but unlike `ocaml_library` it
executes a build action that constructs an OCaml archive. An
`ocaml_archive` may contain `ocaml_library` deps, but may not contain
other `ocaml_archive` deps (since the OCaml compiler will not accept
archives as input to an archive build command).
