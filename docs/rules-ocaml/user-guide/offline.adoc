link:https://docs.bazel.build/versions/0.28.0/guide.html#fetch[Fetching external dependencies] - "By default, Bazel will download and symlink external dependencies during the build. However, this can be undesirable, either because you'd like to know when new external dependendencies are added or because you'd like to 'prefetch' dependencies (say, before a flight where you'll be offline)."
