TODO: how OBazl manages transitive deps.

=== Dependency classes

* direct and indirect
* module v. interface
* configurable ("dynamic") deps
* runtime deps (data v. code)
* PPX co-dependencies
* local v. external deps
* OPAM pkg deps (special case)

=== transitivity

Trickier than it seems, because there are several different kinds of depgraph.

* target depgraph
* action depgraph
* module (implementation) depgraph
* interface depgraph

Depgraphs are fully transitive wrt build actions: when you build a target, its complete depgraph gets built.

OTOH, the kind of transitivity involved in constructing build commands
is only partially transitive. Interface depgraphs are treated
differently than imlementation depgraphs.

Each `ocaml_module` target propagates its module depgraph to its
clients. That includes its own interface dep, but excludes the
interface deps of its module deps.

For example, suppose A.cmo depends on B.cmo, and A.cmi depends on
B.cmi. A.cmo's depgraph will include A.cmi and B.cmo as direct
dependencies. And since B.cmo depends directy on B.cmi, the latter
will be included indirectly in A.cmo's depgraph. But A.cmi's depgraph
will not be included; only A.cmi will be included in A.cmo's depgraph.

Now suppose A.cmi depends on C.cmi in addition to B.cmi, but neither
A.cmo nor B.cmo depend C.cmo. [Can this happen?] Then A.cmo depends on
A.cmi, but not C.cmi; iow, it only uses the API declared by A.cmi.
Building A.cmi will ccause C.cmi to be built, but the result need not
be added to the depgraph of A.cmo, because the compiler will not need
to find C.cmo in order to compile A.cmo. It only needs to find A.cmi.


To build A, we need B.cmi and B.cmo on the search path. Since A.cmo
depends on B.cmo, and B.cmo depends on B.cmi, ... B.cmi must be listed
as an input the the A build action, so it must be provided by the
B.cmo depgraph.  But it is not provided by the A.cmi dep, even though A.cmi depends on B.cmi.


=== discovery v. normalization v. optimization



=== Separation of concerns:  dep mgmt v. build

Build tasks involve explicit build commands, but they also always
involve a critical bit of information that is often hidden or only
implicit, namely the graph of the target's dependencies. Dependency
management is a well-known pain point for OCaml builds; the entire
dependency graph of a build target must be made available to the
compiler, and for archive and executable targets, must be listed
explicitly on the command line in dependency order. By and large,
managing dependencies by hand is infeasible for all but the most simple
projects.

The strategy for managing dependencies adopted by Bazel (and thus
OBazl) is starkly different from that of most other build systems.

[FIXME: three points:

* finding and listing deps as input to the build
* transparency of actual depgraphs (inspection using `query "deps(...)`, `aquery`, `--output_groups=closure`, etc.)
* how OBazl normalizes and propagates depgraphs, advantages compared to dune, e.g. ppx_codeps]

Many build systems, Dune included, conflate dependency _discovery_ and
the build process. For example, Makefiles for building OCaml projects
usually run `ocamldep` to generate `.depends` files listing
dependencies, and build targets depend on these dynamically generated
files. Dune build stanzas list direct dependencies, but indirect
dependencies are discovered (using `ocamldep`) and added to the build
dependency graph as part of the build process.

By contrast, Bazel enforces a strict separation between dependency
discovery and the build process. All dependencies must be explicitly
enumerated for Bazel before the build process begins; discovering and
adding a dependency in the course of the build process is disallowed.
This is a necessary feature of any hermetic (replicable) build
process: if you want to design a replicable experiment, you start by
fixing the initial conditions. Build systems that allow dynamic
discovery and injection of dependencies cannot guarantee hermeticity.  [WARNING: this is not accurate, to be revised]

The downside of having to explicitly enumerate the entire dependency
graph for a project is that you have to explicitly enumerate the
entire dependency graph for the project. But this is obviously a task
that can and should be addressed by a build tool, just as it is for
systems that do this discovery during the build process. The only
difference is that for Bazel we run the dependency discovery tool
_before_ the build process commences, and we record its results and
pass them as input to the build process.

Version 2 of OBazl includes tooling that can largely if not entirely
automate the enumeration of dependencies. Currently there are some
cases where it is difficult to discover all dependencies; for example
targets that involve lots of indirection, `-open` arguments and
`include` directives in source files. A goal of the OBazl project is
to perfect this tool so that can always emit complete and correct
dependency graphs.

Another notable feature of OBazl with respect to dependencies is that
we get correct ordering for free, so to speak. Dependency ordering for
compiler inputs, and for most build tools, is expressed syntactically,
as list ordering (which is in part why managing deps in such systems
is difficult). But OBazl maintains dependencies as a graph structure,
so ordering is expressed as hierarchy. The only way to express a
dependency of A on B is to list B explicitly in the `deps` attribute
of A; there is no way to express it as the list `B A`, as one must do
on the compiler command line. In particular, listing `["A", "B"] in a
`deps`` attribute does not express a dependency of B on A. In fact, it
could be the case that A depends on B (either directly or indirectly),
so when we serialize the graph derived from this list we will get `B
A`. It follows that dependencies can be listed in any order; you can
list them in alphabetical order if you wish.

The critical feature here is that Bazel provides out-of-the-box
support for merging dependency graphs. If your dependencies are
expressed as ordered lists, and you have multiple dependencies, then
you have the task of merging the ordered lists in such a way that
dependency order is maintained, which is non-trivial, since the same
item may occur in different contexts in more than one list. [TODO:
simple example]. Bazel provides a `depset` facility that handles such
merging automatically and efficiently. OBazl rules use depsets to
manage all dependencies.

deps; runtime code deps (plugins); ppx-codeps



=== Configurable ("dynamic") deps
