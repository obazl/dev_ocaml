OBazl convention:

* Create or edit `.bazelrc` (in the project root directory, which
  should also contain `WORKSPACE.bazel`), adding as the final line:
  `try-import dev/user.bazelrc`. This file should go under version
  control.

* Create `dev/.gitignore` and put it under version control.

  * `dev/.gitignore` should contain one line: `*`. This keeps `dev/`
    under version control so it is available to all developers, but
    everything it contains is gitignored, so developers can use it for
    private files like `user.bazelrc`.

* Create `dev/user.bazelrc` and populate it _ad libitum_.

At a minimum you will probably want to add the following to your `user.bazelrc`.

```
common --color=yes
build --subcommands=pretty_print
build --verbose_failures
build --sandbox_debug
```

The `common` command makes the option apply to all Bazel commands
(e.g. `build`, `query`, etc.). The `build` options listed only apply
to the `build` command, which is why they do not use `common`.

You can control these with a command line flag by adding a "grouping"
suffix. For example, if you prefer to usually build without these
debugging options, but want to be able to flip them on with a command
line switch, you can add a suffix like `:dbg`

```
build:dbg --subcommands=pretty_print
build:dbg --verbose_failures
build:dbg --sandbox_debug
```

Then to enable the options pass `--config=dbg` on the command line.

You can use `user.bazelrc` to override remote repo references,
redirecting resolution to a local copy. For example, if you wanted to
develop `rules_ocaml`, you would fork/clone a copy to your local
system, say in `$HOME/bazel/rules_ocaml`, and then add an override to
`user.bazelrc`, using an absolute path:

```
common --override_repository=obazl_rules_ocaml=/home/<UID>/bazel/rules_ocaml
```

This tells Bazel to resolve all references to the `@obazl_rules_ocaml`
namespace to your local copy.
