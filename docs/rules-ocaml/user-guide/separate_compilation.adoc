One of the distinguishing features of OCaml is its support for
separate compilation of interfaces and implementations. But there is
more to it than just separate compilation. Dependencies can also be
expressed independently - _if_ the build tool supports it.

Separate compilation of structfiles and sigfiles is always _possible_ but  it is not _required_.
