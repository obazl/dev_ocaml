== Modules

An OCaml module is a composite formed by pairing a
[signature](#signatures)
and a
[structure](#structures).

== Signatures

A signature expressed as a file is traditionally called an
"interface". The filename conventionally has a ".mli" extension, but
this is not required, since a `-intf` parameter may be used to
designate a sigfile.

OBazl calls such files _signature files_, or _sigfiles_ for short. The
`ocaml_signature` rule is used to compile them.
