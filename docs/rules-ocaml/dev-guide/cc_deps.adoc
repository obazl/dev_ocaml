== CcInfo Provider

link:https://bazel.build/rules/lib/CcInfo#CcInfo[CcInfo] contains only two fields:

* `compilation_context`
* `linking_context`

but both are complex and effectively undocumented.

WARNING: Based on experimentation it looks like a cc_binary used to
produce a shared lib will *not* put its output into the
linking_context of a CcInfo provider. It does provide it in the
DefaultInfo.  Also in runfiles?


=== compilation_context

link:https://bazel.build/rules/lib/CompilationContext[CompilationContext]

CompilationContext contains the headers and "local defines" used to
compile whatever is in the linking_context.

=== linking_context

 linking_ctx type: `CcLinkingContext`

Fields: ["go_link_c_archive", "linker_inputs", "linkstamps"]

`linker_inputs` is a list of `CcLinkingContext$LinkerInput`, evidently link:https://bazel.build/rules/lib/LinkerInput[LinkerInput].

`CcLinkingContext$LinkerInput` Fields:   ["additional_inputs", "libraries", "linkstamps", "owner", "user_link_flags"]

We're interested in the `libraries` field, a list of `AutoValue_LibraryToLink_AutoLibraryToLink`.  Apparently this is a link:https://bazel.build/rules/lib/LibraryToLink[LibraryToLink].

Fields of library-to-link:  ["alwayslink", "dynamic_library", "interface_library", "lto_bitcode_files", "must_keep_debug", "objects", "pic_lto_bitcode_files", "pic_objects", "pic_shared_non_lto_backends", "pic_static_library", "resolved_symlink_dynamic_library", "resolved_symlink_interface_library", "shared_non_lto_backends", "static_library"]


An example of what a library-to-link looks like. This was delivered by a `cc_library` target hat depends on the OCaml C SDK (`@ocaml//c`):

----
  lib[0][0].alwayslink == None
  lib[0][0].dynamic_library == None
  lib[0][0].interface_library == None
  lib[0][0].lto_bitcode_files == None
  lib[0][0].must_keep_debug: <built-in method must_keep_debug of LibraryToLink value>

  lib[0][0].static_library: <generated file interop/ffi/case110/cclibs/liblibalpha.a>
----

This is the first lib in the first linkerinput.

This has both a `static_library` and a list of `objects`, which tells
us that the library was produced by rule (rather than a precompiled
imported library).

In this case, it is the first LinkerInput in linker_inputs; the second
LinkerInput contains (in this case) 13 libraries; they are the
libraries in the OCaml C SDK dependency of the rule.

In managing CC deps, we only want to retain direct dependencies. In
this case, that is the first LinkerInput. The other LinkerInputs were
only needed to produce the first. We do not need to retain them for
OCaml linking.
