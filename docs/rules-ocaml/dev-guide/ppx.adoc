Ppx modules may depend on standard modules, but standard modules cannot depend on ppx modules.]]

With proper toolchain support, PPX management becomes a little more complicated.

When a build target depends on a tool (an executable) that also gets
built, Bazel makes a configuration transition to ensure the tool is
built with the proper toolchain. Since such tools are presumably
intended to run on the build host, the transition is intended to
ensure the toolchain used to build the tool targets the build host.

The configuration transition selects a toolchain for building the
tool, and by transitivity that toolchain will be used to build any
dependencies of the tool. This works, but ppx codeps throw a spanner
into the works. PPX codependencies are injected into code transformed
by a PPX executable. That means they must be built using the same
toolchain as the one used for the target whose dependency on the PPX
caused the configuration transition.

For example, suppose we are building module `A` with a native->vm
toolchain. That means we build A with `ocamlc.opt`, which is native
compiled (it runs on the build host, which is the local "native" machine)
but emits bytecode (its target host is the OCaml VM).

Suppose also that target `A` has attribute `ppx = ":ppx.exe"`. This
attribute is marked `executable = True`, which means it must also be
defined with a `cfg` property set to either `exec` or `target`. The
former tells Bazel to transition to the platform configuration of the
build host; the latter, to that of the target host. For
cross-compilation, setting it to `exec` prevents the tool from being
built to the target platform. Note that `cfg` may also be set to a
user-defined transition function.

Now `ppx.exe` will have its own dependencies; they will be built using
the same toolchain selected for building `ppx.exe`, since the
configuration used to select the toolchain for each target will be the
one set for `ppx.exe` - which is controlled by the `cfg` property of
the `ppx` attribute of the `A` target. Since we're building `A` with a
cross-compiler (from native to bytecode), the `cfg="exec"` transition
will set the parameters that select the native->native toolchain for
building `ppx.exe` and its dependencies. We'll call this the "ppx
toolchain".

But now suppose one of those dependencies is a `ppx_module`{fn-ppxmodule}: -- let's
call it module `PpxB` --that injects a dependency into the files it
transforms. For example suppose it injects some code that depends on
module `C`. Then when `ppx.exe` (which includes `PpxB`) transforms a
file, say `foo.ml`, the result will be a source file whose compilation
depends on `C`. Which means in turn that module `C` must be compiled
with the original native->vm toolchain used to compile module `A`,
_not_ the native->native PPX toolchain.

With OBazl we express such dependencies using the `ppx_codeps`
attribute of rule `ppx_module`. The problem then is that these become
(indirect) dependencies of `ppx.exe`, which means they will be
compiled with the PPX toolchain, which is native->native. This won't
cause a problem until we try to link `A` into an executable. The
compiler will complain `don't know what to do with c.cmxa`, since
we're using `ocamlc.opt` which expects to see `.cma` files on the
command line, not `.cmxa` files.

This is of course a toy example, but this situation would arise in
true cross-compilation scenarios, say where the build host is x86 and
the target host is arm. In that case, the ppx_codeps would be built
with the x86->x86 toolchain instead of the x86->arm toolchain, with
the same results.

Just to complicate things a little more: ppx module sources themselves may
undergo PPX transformation. So we could have a scenario where we need
to ppx process `a.ml` using `ppxA.exe`, which depends on a ppx module
needing ppx transformation by `ppxB.exe`, which depends on another ppx
module needing transformation by `ppxC.exe`, and so on.

For now we just set `cfg = "target"`, and that works where the
cross-compile is just between native and bytecode. We can get away
with this because we can always run the PPX executable on either
platform, native or bytecode. So for example if we're using the
native->vm toolchain, we do not need to target the native platform for
our ppx executables, because we can always run the vm. In other words
the VM is always available to us even when we're running our tools
natively.

 But this won't work when we get to real cross-compiling like
x86->arm. For example suppose our local host is x86 and we want to
target ARM. Then we will need an x86->arm cross-toolchain to serve as
our primary toolchain running on our local build host. But when it
comes time to build PPX executables and run them (on our build host)
to transform source code, we will need a secondary x86->x86 toolchain.
And we will have to ensure that PPX co-dependencies are built with the
primary x86->arm toolchain.

Here is how OBazl plans to address the issue.

* We attach a transition function to the `ppx` attribute (of `ocaml_module` and `ocaml_signature`)
** the transition function writes the current toolchain config to a pair of build settings

For ppx codeps we have two scenarios:

* Precompiled codeps that we import using `opam_import` (or
  `ocaml_import`). The import rules import both bytecode (`.cma`) and
  native (`cmxa`) archives. Rule logic reads the toolchain config info
  to decide which to integrate into the build.
* codeps that we need to build. In this case, we have to ensure that
  the correct toolchain is selected for ppx codependencies.

We attach another transition function of attr `ppx_codeps`. By the
time it receives control, the toolchain build settings have been
written (by the `ppx` transition function), so the `ppx_codeps`
transition function uses that information to reset the build settings
determining toolchain selection.

The build settings recording the toolchain config params are only used
by opam_import? Everywhere else its a matter of toolchain selection,
which is handled by Bazel.
