Hosts:

* bazelhost - where Bazel runs.  Bazel vernacular: "host"
* buildhost - where the build tools run. Bazel vernacular: "exec"
* targethost - platform targeted by build tools.  Bazel vernacular: "target"

== toolchain modeling

* binding constraints: a set of constraints that, when satisfied, bind
  a toolchain adapter to `ctx.toolchains[<toolchain type>]`. Toolchain
  binding contraints are expressed using the built-in `toolchain`
  rule, by listing `constraint_values` defined by platform constraints.

* toolchain adapter: a rule (defined by the ruleset author) that
  models the OCaml toolchain expected by `rules_ocaml`. The attributes
  of the rule represent the elements of the toolchain (e.g. compiler).
  Developers use the toolchain adapter rule to "adapt" their
  particular toolchain to the OCaml toolchain model. E.g. by setting
  the `compiler` attribute to point to a compiler.

* platform constraints: a set of `constraint_setting` and
  `constraint_value` targets used by binding constraints and platform
  definitions.

* platform definition - collection of `constraint_values` that are set
  to `True` when the platform definition is passed on the command line
  using `--host_platform` or `--platforms`.

Only the toolchain adapter rule (that is, the OCaml toolchain model)
is defined by `rules_ocaml`. It's up to the devloper to provide:

* toolchain adapter targets that bind toolchain files to the toolchain model;
* platform constraints and definitions
* targets using the `toolchain` rule to express binding constraints

The OBazl toolsuite provides a tool that automatically generates all
of this for OPAM toolchains. The generated code has the following
structure:

----
ocaml
├── WORKSPACE.bazel
...
├── toolchain
│   ├── adapters
│   │   ├── linux

│       ├── build

│       └── target
│           └── BUILD.bazel
----

For example:

* `@ocaml//toolchain/platform_constraints/target:target` is a
  `constraint_setting` with two `constraint_value` s:
  ** `@ocaml//toolchain/platform_constraints/target:local`
  ** `@ocaml//toolchain/platform_constraints/target:vm`

* `@ocaml//toolchain/binding_constraints/macos:macos_x86_64` is a
  `toolchain` rule target:

.caml/toolchain/binding_constraints/macos/BUILD.bazel
[source, python]
----
toolchain(
    name           = "macos_x86_64",  <1>
    toolchain      = "@ocaml//toolchain/adapters/macos:x86_64",  <2>
    toolchain_type = "@rules_ocaml//toolchain:type",
    exec_compatible_with = [  <3>
        "@platforms//os:macos",
        "@platforms//cpu:x86_64",
    ],
    target_compatible_with = [  <4>
        "@platforms//os:macos",
        "@platforms//cpu:x86_64",
    ],
    visibility             = ["//visibility:public"],
)
----

<1> In this case buildhost == targethost, so we need not list both in
the name
<2> This toolchain adapter will be selected if all the
constraints are satisfied.
<3> meaning, "the toolchain adapter listed in the toolchain attribute
may be selected to run on the buildhost ("exec") if these two
`@platforms` constraints are satisfied for the buildhost".
<4> meaning, "the toolchain adapter listed in the toolchain attribute
may be selected (to run on the buildhost) if these two
`@platforms` constraints are satisfied for the target host".

NOTE: Constraints in the `@platforms` workspace are predefined by Bazel.

A cross-platform toolchain binding might look like this (toy example):

.caml/toolchain/binding_constraints/macos/BUILD.bazel
[source, python]
----
toolchain(
    name           = "macos_x86_64__macos_arm",  <1>
    toolchain      = "@ocaml//toolchain/adapters/macos:x86_64__arm",
    toolchain_type = "@rules_ocaml//toolchain:type",
    exec_compatible_with = [            <2>
        "@platforms//os:macos",
        "@platforms//cpu:x86_64",
    ],
    target_compatible_with = [            <3>
        "@platforms//os:linux",
        "@platforms//cpu:arm",
    ],
    visibility             = ["//visibility:public"],
)
----
<1> Naming convention:  `<buildhost>__<targethost>`
<2> Buildhost where tools run is macos on x86_64
<3> Target host is linux on arm


The platform definitions are in `@opam//tc/host/build` and
`@opam//tc/host/target`.

For example:

.@opam//tc/host/target:BUILD.bazel
[source, python]
----
platform(name = "macos_x86_64",
         constraint_values = [
             "@platforms//os:macos",
             "@platforms//cpu:x86_64"
         ])
----
