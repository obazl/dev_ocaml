OBazl supports three kinds of OPAM switch configuration:

* System switch - installed by default in `$(HOME)/.opam`
** Switches are named, user can specify the name
* Local switch - installed in `_opam`, a subdirectory of a specified directory, usually `$(PWD)`
** The installation directory containing `_opam` is treated as the name of the switch
** Local switches use information in the system OPAM root `~/.opam`, e.g. `~/.opam/repo`
* Here switch -  installed in `<projroot>/.opam`
** TODO: make it `<projroot>/.obazl.d/_opam`
** Here switch initialization also creates an OPAM root, so they are
   independent of the system OPAM root

All three may be used as the basis of a project's OBazl coswitch.

== System Switches

== Local Switches

link:https://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-local-switches/[OPAM Local Switches]

A "local switch" is an OPAM switch whose name is a directory
path; usually this will be the working directory `./` (which OPAM will
expand to an absolute path). The switch itself is located in the
`./_opam` subdirectory. OPAM commands detect the presence of `./_opam`
and automatically set it as the current switch.

Cmd: `$ opam create . --packages <pkg1>,<pkg2>...`

This creates a switch in the global OPAM installation (default
location: `$HOME/.opam`), named `$(PWD)` and located at
`$(PWD)/_opam`. To see the expanded switch name, run `$ opam switch
show`.

OBazl can be configured to use a local directory switch as a project
`here-coswitch`; see
link:/tools-opam/user-guide/here-configuration[Here-coswitch
configuration] and
link:/tools-opam/reference/here-create[@opam//here:create] for more
information.

=== Compiler build variants

The OCaml compiler(s) are available in several _buld variants_, which are
controlled by build options. For example, to use the
link:https://v2.ocaml.org/manual/flambda.html[flamba] optimizers, you
must build the compilers with the `-flambda` configuration option.

Under OPAM these build variations are exposed as installable "option
packages", which will ensure that the compilers are built with the
appropriate configuration options. They can be enabled via the
following protocol:

* install the `+options` version of the compiler, e.g.
  `ocaml-variants.4.14.0+options` instead of `ocaml-base-compiler.4.14.0`

* install the desired option package, e.g. `ocaml-option-flambda`.
