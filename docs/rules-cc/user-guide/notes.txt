feature test macros and c lang dialect

with gcc lang dialect and glibc interact
with -std=c11 we need feature test macros for some apis
e.g. for getopt, strdup, some header macros, etc. we need
to define _POSIX_C_SOURCE, or _GNU_SOURCE, etc.
(with -std=gnu11 they seem to be automatically added)

For such cases if we use -std=c11 we need something like:

    local_defines = define_module_version()
    + select({ # getopt
        "@platforms//os:linux": ["_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809L"],
        "//conditions:default": []
    }),
