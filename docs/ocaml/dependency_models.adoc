WARNING: Status: initial draft

Dependency managment for OCaml builds is rather complex. OCaml builds
involve multiple dependency graphs that, while related, must be
managed separately.

== Concepts and Terminology

* API v. SPI
* provider v. consumer
* direct v. indirect deps
* compile-time v. link-time deps
* sig deps v. struct deps
* build actions: compile, archive, link

API: an OCaml signature, composed of fields

API provider: an OCaml struct

SPI: a library composed of (compiled) signatures

SPI provider: a collection of (compiled) modules and sigs?

NB: SPI provider is a build concept. The OCaml language does not
define either "library" or "archive"; it has no first-class concept
corresponding to "SP provider".

* An API provider (i.e. an OCaml struct) must provide _at least_ the fields listed in the API;
* An API consumer (i.e. an OCaml struct?) may reference _at most_ the fields listed in the API;
* An SPI provider (i.e. a library) must provide _at least_ the modules listed in the SPI;
* An SPI consumer (i.e. an OCaml struct?) may reference _at most_ the modules listed in the SPI.

== Build Action Dependencies

Bazel makes a clear distinction between built _targets_ and build
_actions_. A build target is expressed as a rule instantiation, which
lists all direct target dependencies. Each Bazel rule may have one or
more build _actions_, each of which has a list of inputs and outputs.
A rule implementation may select a subset of target dependencies to
use as action inputs.

For example, a module build target (expressed by
rule `ocaml_module`) will list direct module dependencies, but it will
not include dependent modules as inputs to the compile action if
cross-module optimization is disabled (by passing the `-opaque`
compile flag).

On the other hand, dependent modules will always be passed on as
outputs of such a build target; this makes them available as inputs to
any _link_ actions (which are the build actions of rule `ocaml_binary`).

== Module Dependencies

IMPORTANT: Remember that OCaml has two type systems, one for modules
and one for everything else. When referring to modules, _type_ means
_module type_.

A module is a _binding_: a pairing of a signature and a structure,
where the latter _satisfies_ the former. It follows that modules have
two dependency graphs.

The meaning of "module A depends on module B" is surprisingly complicated.

Compiler perspective:: The structure component of module A directly
depends on the signature of module B, but _not_ on the structural
component of module B. The compilation model is similar to that of C,
where compilation of a file that depends on a library requires the
header file(s) of the library, but not its implementation. (An
exception to this protocol involves cross-module optimization,
explained below.)

Linker perspective:: The compiled _structure_ component of module A
depends on the compiled _structure_ component of module B, but not its
signature. Again this is analogous to the model of C linkage, which
requires dependent libraries but not their headers.

IMPORTANT: It follows that a dependency of (Bazel) target A on (Bazel)
target B does _not_ imply dependency of the build actions for A on the
build actions of B! For example, the _compile_ action for A need not
depend on the _compile_ action for B; that is, the result of compiling
B may not be an input to the compile action of A, although it may be
an input to any _link_ action for which A is an imput. The OBazl
ruleset handles these dependencies automatically.

Build system perspective:: Different build systems may handle module
 dependencies in different ways. The OCaml compiler requires that
 signatures be compiled before structures, which makes structures
 dependent on signatures _for compilation_. For _dependency
 resolution_ this is reversed: the depending (structure component of
 the) module depends on the signature component of its dependency, and
 in fact does not even depend on the structure component (that
 dependency only takes effect for the link action). So a build system
 has various ways to interpret "A depends on B". It could record a
 compile-dependency of struct A on sig B and a separate
 link-dependency of struct A on struct B, for example.

Ordering:: This is where another distinction between dependency graph
types is in order. Build languages allow the expression of
dependencies; in OBazl we call those "target dependencies". But the
build program must distinguish between such target dependencies and
the dependencies of build actions, which are not necessarily the same
thing.

For example, given "A depends on B", the target depgraph (for A) will
contain both struct B and sig B (with the former dependent on the
latter). But the depgraph of the _compile action_ for A will include
sig B but not struct B, and the depgraph of any _link action_ that
includes A will include struct B but not sig B.

NOTE: "Module A depends on module B" does not _necessarily_ mean that the
signature of module A depends on the signature of module B. That may
be the case, but it is not entailed by the module dependency.

=== Principal API

Every structure has a _principal API_, which is expressed by its
_principal (module) type_ (a/k/a principal signature).

Every module has a public API, expressed by its signature component.
The public API of a module is a subset of the principal API of its
structure component.

The principal API of a structfile may be extracted from its source
code using the `-i` switch of the compiler.  [TODO: cross-ref]


=== Principal SPI

Every structure (implementation component of a module) has a _Service
Programming Interface (SPI)_. The SPI is composed of all the modules
_directly_ referenced by the code of the structure.

Since each module has an SPI, we can form the transitiive closure of
all SPIs, which gives us the (ordered) list of all module dependencies
needed to compile.  But each SPI contains only direct dependencies.

If we think of a module as a service provider, then the transitive
closure of a module's SPI represents the collection of services that
must be provided to the compiler (by the environment, in practice the
build system) in order for the structure (module) to compile and
function.

SPIs are conceptual; unlike APIs, which are encoded as `.mli/.cmi`
files, SPIs have no formal representation in either the language or
any build systems that I know of. But they are expressed in build
languages as dependency lists.

minimal SPI:: the least set of dependencies sufficient for compilation

principal SPI:: one dep for each explicit ref in the source, without duplicates

Building a module involves (symmettrically) _satisfying_ both the API and the SPI.

To build a module, we bind its signature to a structure that _satisfies_ the signature.

To compile a structure, we need to "bind its SPI" (so to speak) to a
"structure" of modules (dependencies). In practice what this means is
we need to make available to the compiler whatever modules it needs to
resolve symbols in the structfile. But structurally it's just like
binding a structure to a signature, where the structure makes
available whatever is needed to define the symbols in the signature.

So by analogy we will call a collection of modules satisfying a structure's SPI a "depstruct" (???)
