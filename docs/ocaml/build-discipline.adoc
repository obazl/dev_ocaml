WARNING: Status: very rough as of 5/25/22.

The OCaml compilers and tools are very flexible. In particular,
bytecode builds can be customized in a variety of ways.

* meaning of "library"
* Build modes
* Multiple outputs
** Output file types:
*** `.cmo/.cmx`
*** `.cmi`
*** `.o/.a`, `.obj/.lib`
*** `.cma/.cmxa`
*** `.cmxs`
*** `.cmt/.cmti`
*** `.cmir-linear`
*** etc.
** "compilation unit"
** "auxiliary" outputs, e.g. cmt/cmti, intermediate files (asm, etc.)
* custom runtime mode  (for bytecode output)
** `-custom` - linker produces an output file that contains both the runtime system and the bytecode for the program.
** `-make-runtime` - Build a custom runtime system, to be used later to execute bytecode executables produced with the `ocamlc -use-runtime runtime-name` option.
** `-use-runtime` - Generate a bytecode executable file that can be executed on the custom runtime system built earlier with `ocamlc -make-runtime`
* `-pack` and `-for-pack`
* `-nostdlib` - use customized stdlib
* `-i` -  emit interface file
* `-output-obj` - Cause the linker to produce a C object file instead of a bytecode executable file. This is useful to wrap OCaml code as a C library, callable from any C program.
* `-output-complete-exe` - Build a self-contained executable by linking a C object file containing the bytecode program, the OCaml runtime system and any other static C code given to ocamlc.
* `-output-complete-obj` Same as -output-obj options except the object file produced includes the runtime and autolink libraries.
* Dependencies
* Namespacing
* Preprocessing
** `-pp`
** `-ppx`
* `-runtime-variant d` - use debug version of runtime
* `-stop after <pass>` passes: parsing, typing
* `-save-ir-after <pass>` - passes: scheduling. Experimental, native code only
* `-S`  keep assembly code

Special consideration:  `-open`

Executables:

* link:https://v2.ocaml.org/manual/native.html#s:native:running-executable[Running executables produced by ocamlopt,window="_blank"] Executables generated by ocamlopt are native, stand-alone executable files that can be invoked directly. They do not depend on the ocamlrun bytecode runtime system nor on dynamically-loaded C/OCaml stub libraries.


== link:https://v2.ocaml.org/manual/compunit.html#s:compilation-units[Compilation Units]


"Compilation units bridge the module system and the separate
compilation system. A compilation unit is composed of two parts: an
interface and an implementation. The interface contains a sequence of
specifications, just as the inside of a `sig … end` signature
expression. The implementation contains a sequence of definitions and
expressions, just as the inside of a `struct … end` module expression.
A compilation unit also has a name unit-name, derived from the names
of the files containing the interface and the implementation"

[quote, 'link:https://v2.ocaml.org/manual/moduleexamples.html#s:separate-compilation[5. Modules and separate compilation]']
____
A compilation unit A comprises two files:

* the implementation file A.ml, which contains a sequence of definitions, analogous to the inside of a struct…end construct;
* the interface file A.mli, which contains a sequence of specifications, analogous to the inside of a sig…end construct.

These two files together define a structure +[sic]+ named A as if the following definition was entered at top-level:
----
module A: sig (* contents of file A.mli *) end
        = struct (* contents of file A.ml *) end;;"
----
____

"These two files together define a structure" - this kind of
sloppiness can be very, _very_ confusing to newcomers.


OBazl eschews this terminology on grounds that a compilation _unit_
should be non-decomposible.

The only "bridge" between the (language-defined) module system and the
"separate compilation system" is the build discipline defined by the
tools.

In fact it is difficult to give a clear, concise, and simple
definition of "unit of compilation" for OCaml. Why? UoC spans both the
language and the tooling. On the one hand the UoC for the language is
any minimal bit of syntax that can be compiled. But from the
perspective of building, unit of compilation usually means "source
file" or similar. That is, it is file-system oriented. Hence
"file-system unit of compilation"? And since "module" is a concept of
the language, not the build system (ie. not involving the FS), it
cannot be a FS unit of compilation.

FS UoC v. OCaml UoC

The FS units of compilation are sigfiles and structfiles. But this
does not mean that units of compilation can always be _independently_
compiled. In practice the units of compilation are sigfiles and
structfiles _together with_ their dependencies.

And to complicate things: a _compiled_ module is itself a composite of
two compiled units, the struct and the sig.

The docs say "A compilation unit is composed of two parts: an
interface and an implementation." OBazl says: a module is composed of
two compilation units. Or more precisely, a module is composed of a
signature and a structure; _filesystem_ module is composed of two
compilation units, a (compiled) sigfile and a (compiled) structfile.

1. Structfiles always depend on compiled sigfiles.
2. Both may depend on other compiled modules, via OCaml's `include`
directive.

== Modules and the File System

TBD


=== Dyadic Modules

A _dyadic_ module is a filesystem module composed of a structfile and a sigfile.

=== Orphaned structfiles

An _orphaned_ structfile is a structfile with no corresponding
sigfile; that is, no sigfile with matching principal name.

NOTE: principal name = file name with extension removed. E.g. the
principal name of `foo.ml` is `foo`.

An _orphan_ module is a filesystem module derived from an orphaned
structfile. Orphan modules are still composed of two compilation
units, one for the signature and one for the structure, but the
signature is the principal signature inferred from the orphaned
structfile. For example, from orphaned structfile `foo.ml` the
compiler with infer and then compile `foo.mli`. The compiler will emit
`foo.cmi` but not `foo.mli`.

The compiler will extract `foo.mli` if you pass it the `-i` option.
The OBazl rule `ocaml_module`, though, does not support this option
currently. If you want to extract the principal signature for a
structfile, you can use a tool from `tools_obazl`:

----
$ bazel run @tools_obazl//sig:extract --@tools_obazl//ocamlobj=//package:target
----

This tool will `build` the target `//package:target` and then run
`cmitomli` (which you must have installed in the OPAM switch you're
using; see X for more information on this) on the emitted `.cmx/.cmo` file.

You can shorten this by defining a `flag_alias` in your `.bazelrc`:

----
build --flag_alias=obj=@tools_obazl//ocamlobj
----

Then you can run:

----
$ bazel run @tools_obazl//sig:extract --obj=//package:target
----

You can shorten it further by defining a local alias for
`@tools_obazl//sig:extract`; e.g. in your root `BUILD.bazel` file:

----
alias(name = "gensig", actual = "@tools_obazl//sig:extract")
----

Then you can run:

----
$ bazel run :gensig --obj=//package:target
----



==== Principal Signature

=== Cross-Module Optimization

"When the native compiler compiles an implementation, by default it produces a .cmx file containing information for cross-module optimization. It also expects .cmx files to be present for the dependencies of the currently compiled source, and uses them for optimization. Since OCaml 4.03, the compiler will emit a warning if it is unable to locate the .cmx file of one of those dependencies."
-- Ch 14 Native-code compilation

In other words, the `.cmx` files are only needed for cross-module
optimization. The `.cmi` files, by contrast, are always needed for
symbol resolution. Both are needed for linking to an executable.

Which suggests that the code produced by compiling a module contains
only references to its dependencies; it does not embed the referenced code.

In other words, a compiled OCaml module is analogous (for build
purposes) to a C library. To link it you must list it explicitly as a
linkable resource so the linker knows about it, but to compile
something that depends on it you only need the `.cmi` file.

Or: the .cmi files are analogous the C header files. You do not need
the compiled dep in C to compile your client code to a `.o` file; you
only need the headers with function prototypes, etc. It's only when
you go to link your `.o` files into a library or executable that you
need the `.o` files it depends on; you don't need them when you're
compiling.

Same story for OCaml .cmi and .cmx files. You don't need the .cmx file
of a dep to compile your code (unless you want cross-module
optimization), but you do need the .cmi file that exposes the
interface of the .cmx file, and you need the .cmx file to link your
(compiled) code.




* `-opaque`
* `-no-alias-deps`

If a module A depends on module B:

* compilation of module A always depends on b.cmi, but may not depend on b.cmx.
** b.cmx is only needed for cross-module optimization, which may be disabled by `-opaque`
* linking module A into an executable always requires b.cmx (and b.cmi) to be linked first
* linking module A into an archive means ...?

In other words, "module dependency" has multiple meanings. We have
compile-time dependencies and link-time dependencies, and they are not
necessarily the same.

In other other words, the OCaml compilers conflate compilation and linking.


=== Orphans

A structfile without a corresponding sigfile is an orphan.


== File Types

[cols="1,1,1,1"]
|===
| action | input | output | remarks

| compile sig | a.mli | a.cmi |

| compile struct | a.ml | a.cmo, a.cmi | bytecode compile
| compile struct | a.ml | a.cmx, a.o, a.cmi | native compile

| compile struct | a.ml, a.cmi | a.cmo | bytecode compile
| compile struct | a.ml, a.cmi | a.cmx, a.o | native compile

| archive | a.cmo | a.cma | bytecode
| archive | a.cmx, a.a | a.cmxa, a.a | native

| link | a.cmo, a.cma | a.byte | bytecode executable
| link | a.cmx, a.o, a.cmxa, a.a | a.out | native executable

Q: a.cmi input to archive action? iow can an archive contain a standalone sig?

Q: what about dynamic linking, e.g. a.cmxs?



== The `open` and `include` directives


NOTE: The OCaml language definition does not use the term "directive" for these keywords.

Compare the C build discipline. A source file like `foo.c` is a unit
of composition, but only _after_ preprocessing. If `foo.c` contains
`#include "foo.h"`, then the textual content of the latter will be
embedded in the textual content of the former, forming the compilation
unit.

The OCaml `include` directive does not work textually like this. If
the text of module `A` contains `include B`, this tells the compiler
to embed module `B` _compiled_ in module `A`.

For sigs: link:https://v2.ocaml.org/manual/modtypes.html#sss:mty-include[Including a signature,window="_blank"]

FIXME: "The expression `include module-type` in a signature performs
textual inclusion of the components of the signature denoted by
`module-type`. ". Not clear what "textual inclusion" means. Does it
mean the source text? I don't think it can. `module-type` does
not necessarily correspond to a source file.


For structs: link:https://v2.ocaml.org/manual/modules.html#sss:mexpr-include[Including the components of another structure,window="_blank"]

"The expression include module-expr in a structure re-exports in the current structure all definitions of the structure denoted by module-expr. "
