WARNING: Very rough as of 5/25/22. The goal is to provide a very
concise overview of the language, in particular those parts/features
of the language that affect the build discipline, such as modules,
separate compilation, top-level module aliases and namespacing,
PPXs, etc.

Why OCaml? Aside from practical considerations, OCaml is
directly based on the Mother of All (Higher-order,Strictly
typed,Functional,Algebraic) Programming Languages: ML. It wasn't the
first language to include most of these features, but it was the first
language to include type inference. (source: link:https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/influential-dead-languages/[10 MOST(LY DEAD) INFLUENTIAL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES,window="_blank"])


== History

ML began as the Meta Language of link:https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/3-540-09724-4[Edinburgh LCF,window="_blank"].

== The Module System

What is a module?  Simple question with a surprisingly complicated answer.

Compare: what is an integer? Easy answer: an integer is a token
("value") of type Int. Why "token" instead of "value"? The latter
suggests evaluation, which is a computation notion that does not apply
to types and tokens. A type is a universal; a token is a particular,
end of story. "x is an Int" just means that x is a particular (token)
subsumed under the general concept (type) Int.

CAUTION: `module` is a keyword in the OCaml language, but it is not a
type constant; there is no module type in OCaml.

"Module" is not a first-class object. That is, modules are not values
of a Module type; there is no type Module. In fact a "module" is
neither a value nor a type. It's a pragmatic term used to refer to a
pairing of a struct and a sig. Or rather, its a generic term used to
refer to a whole class of module types, just as "list" is often used
to refer to Int List, String List, etc.

=== Signatures and Structures

Compatible sigfile - sigfile satisfied by structfile, irrespective of location and principle name.

Matching sigfile - a compatible sigfile with same principle name, in same directory

I.e. compatibility is structural, matching is nominal and structural.

Compatible structfile - a structfile satisfying the sig, irrespective of location and principle name.

Matching structfile - compatible structfile with same principle name in same dir as sigfile.

From an algebraic perspective, the type constructed by `sig...end`
expresses an algebraic signature. So it makes sense to call it a
"signature type" or just "signature" with the caveat that "signature"
never means "token of type signature". The tokens of such a type are
structs, not signatures.

From the perspective of OCaml's module system, the type constructed by
`sig...end` expresses a module type, whose tokens are structs.

A module is thus the binding of a module (signature) type and a
struct.

WARNING: In the literature "module" is often used to refer to the
struct component of a module.

TODO: explicate "struct satisfies signature"

A signature can be bound to any struct that satisfies it. In OCaml
such type assignments are static, fixed at compile time.

Developers may want to select a struct for binding to a signature,
based on configuration constraints. A common case is selection of
platform-dependent code, where we have one struct for linux and one
for macos. Static typing means that this selection and type assignment
must occur at compile time.

----
module type B = sig val msg : string end

module  Blinux : B = struct let msg = "linux msg" end
module  Bmacos : B = struct let msg = "macos msg" end
----

The problem with this is that clients would have to use the
platform-specific name. The modules here are named Blinux and Bmacos,
not B.

NOTE: Recall that the module names are independent of sig and struct
names. We could have a sig named ASig, a struct named AStruct, and
bind them to produce a module named A: `module A : ASig = AStruct`

NOTE: OCaml uses different namespaces for module (signature) type
names and module names, so the same name, e.g. A, can be used for both
a sig and a module, e.g. `module A : A = struct...end`: the first A
names a module and the second names a module (signature) type.

To get a module named B, binding signature B to a struct selected
based on platform, we need something like the following:

----
module B : B = if platform == "linux" then Blinux else Bmacos
----

Unfortunately that's syntactically malformed so it won't compile. The
syntax on the right-hand side of the equality sign `=` in a module
definition cannot be an if-then expression.

This  won't work either:

----
if platform == "linux" then module B : B = Blinux else module B : B = Bmacos
----

But this _does_ work:

----
if platform == "linux"
then let module B : B = Blinux in
     begin print_endline B.msg end
else let module B : B = Bmacos in
     begin print_endline B.msg end
----

The problem with this is that the selected module B is only accessible
within the local `begin...end`, so we might as well just write:

----
if platform == "linux"
then print_endline Blinux.msg
else print_endline Bmacos.msg
----

Summary: this kind of selection cannot be expressed within the
language. But it can be expressed using filesystem modules; see XXX
for details.


==== Principal Signature

=== Module Bindings


=== Module Types as Dependent Types

Example:

----
module M : sig val x : int end = struct let x = 42 end
----

This means that `M` is a token constructed by `struct let x = 42 end`,
whose type is constructed by `sig val x : int end`.

A type constructed in this manner is a kind of dependent type. Under
standard usage, "dependent type" means a type parameterized by a value
of some (first-order) type such as `Int`; for example, the type of
lists of strings of length four. The type constructor for such a type
would be parameterized by the type constant `String` and the integer
value `4`.

The type constructor `sig ... end` is parameterized by a set of
"fields", which are type declarations like `val x:int`. (TODO: list
the allowable fields).

NOTE: the type constructed by `sig ... end` should not be treated as a
signature or signature type.  "signature" is the type constructor, not the type.

The types constructed by `sig...end` may be named by using `module type`; for example:

----
module type MSig = sig ... end
----

This declares that `MSig` names the type constructed by `sig...end`.
Compare: `let f = λx.x+1`, which declares that `f` names the function
described by the lambda expression `λx.x+1`.

Module as family of types. Type ctor is `sig...end`; token ctor is
`struct ...end`.

Structs do not have intrinsic types, so there is no "natural" type
that goes with a struct; the type of a struct must be _assigned_ by
binding it to a signature. Modules are thus always in a sense ad-hoc.

However, every struct does have a _principal signature_...

"x is an Int" means x is a value whose type is Int.

"xs is an Int List" means x is a value whose type is Int List.

"A is a module" does _not_ mean that A is a value whose type is Module.

What does it mean? That A names a value whose type was
constructed by `sig ... end`.  Its type may or may not be named.

Compare: lambda expression as definite description of a function. The
function and its type remain unnamed.

== syntactic quirks

=== semicolons

"For compatibility with toplevel phrases (chapter 12), optional `;;`
are allowed after and before each definition in a structure. These `;;`
have no semantic meanings. Similarly, an expr preceded by `;;` is
allowed as a component of a structure. It is equivalent to `let _ =
expr`, i.e. expr is evaluated for its side-effects but is not bound to
any identifier. If expr is the first component of a structure, the
preceding `;;` can be omitted." --
