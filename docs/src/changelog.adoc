= Changelog: rules_ocaml

== Version 2:

=== Breaking Changes

* renaming
  ** `ocaml_module` attributes `src` and `intf` renamed to `struct` and `sig`, respectively
  ** `modules` attribute of `ocaml_library` and `ocaml_archive` renamed to `manifest`
  ** rule `ocaml_interface` renamed to `ocaml_signature`
  ** `deps_adjunct` renamed to `ppx_codeps` (i.e. co-dependencies)
  ** OPAM package labels now have the form `@pkg//:pkg`; subpackages
  have the form `@pkg//subpkg`, or ``@pkg//subpkg1/subpkg2`; for
  example, `ppx_deriving.eq -> @ppx_deriving//eq`, `mtime.clock.os ->
  @mtime//clock/os`. To make these targets available the new
  link:/tools-opam/user-guide[OPAM bootstrapper tool,window=_blank]
  must be run separately.
* namespacing support has been thoroughly revised, see below for details

* deletions
  ** all `ppx_*` rules except `ppx_executable` removed
  ** attribute `deps_opam` removed; opam deps are no longer special, and are treated like any other dep
  ** attribute `deps_adjunct_opam` removed

=== Non-breaking changes

* Toolchain support has changed drastically, but this should not
effect existing code, except insofar as OPAM dependencies must be
changed as noted above. For example version 1 generated build commands
that used `ocamlfind`, which it assumed to be installed in OPAM.
Version 2 does not use `ocamlfind`; the commands it generates invoke
the OCaml compilers directly, via the toolchain interface. This change
should not affect existing build code.

=== New stuff

* bottom-up namespacing

* toolchain independence

* cc deps produced by `cc_*` rules (e.g. `cc_library`) may be added directly to the `deps` attribute of `ocaml_module`
* new rules:

  ** link:/rules-ocaml/reference/ocaml-rules#_ocaml_ns_resolver[ocaml_ns_resolver]

  ** link:/rules-ocaml/reference/ocaml-rules#_ocaml_test[ocaml_test]
