== Signatures


NOTE:  note

A signature expressed as a file is traditionally called an "interface"
file. The filename conventionally has a ".mli" extension, but this is
not required. The standard compilers support options that allow the
programmer to designate a different extension for interface files.

OBazl calls such files _signature files_, or _sigfiles_ for short.


There are two ways to compile a sigfile. One is to pass the sigfile as
a direct dependency of an `ocaml_module` target, using the `sig`
attribute:

```
module_binding/proper/sigsrcdep
├── BUILD.bazel
├── hello.ml
├── hello.mli
```

.module_binding/proper/sigsrcdep/BUILD.bazel
```python
ocaml_module(name = "Hello", struct = "hello.ml", sig = "hello.mli")
```

The other way is to compile the signature separately, using the `ocaml_signature` rule:

.https://github.com/obazl/dev_obazl/blob/main/demos/aggregators/ocaml_archives/case110/BUILD.bazel[demos/aggregators/ocaml_archives/case110/BUILD.bazel]
```python
ocaml_signature(name = "Hello_cmi", src = "hello.mli")
ocaml_module(name = "Hello", struct = "hello.ml", sig = ":Hello_cmi")
```
