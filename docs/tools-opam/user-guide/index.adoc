must run `bazel run @opam//here:refresh` after the move.

OBazl provides:

* OPAM bootstrapper tools that generate Bazel files containing
  repository and build targets for everything in the current OPAM
  switch. This makes all OPAM packages accessible under standard Bazel
  labels, such as `@yojson//:yojson` for `yojson` and
  `@mtime//clock/os` for `mtime.clock.os`. The bootstrapper must be
  run before the build; this eliminates the need to run a tool like
  `ocamlfind` during the build in order to integrate OPAM dependencies.
* A toolchain that makes the OCaml compilers and other tools (e.g.
  `ocamllex`) accessible to the OBazl ruleset under standard Bazel
  labels. The toolchain depends on a workspace named `@ocaml`
  containing build targets for the OCaml tools. Executables must be
  targets in the `@ocaml//bin` package; for example, the bytecode
  compiler label is `@ocaml//bin:ocamlc`. This has the useful
  side-effect of making the OCaml tools accessible to `genrule`
  targets. The OPAM bootstrapper generates such a workspace, but since
  the OBazl-defined toolchain depends only on labels, it may be
  replaced with a workspace whose target labels resolve to a
  customized OCaml toolchain.

A primary goal of OBazl is to support fully hermetic OCaml builds. For
reasons explained below, hermetic builds are not possible with a
standard OPAM installation. The remainder of this article describes
the problems and OBazl's approach to addressing them.
