------------------------------------------

misc
----

Some OPAM packages depend on libraries installed on the local system:

-   all of the conf-\* libs? e.g.Â conf-gmp
-   pkg-config is require by something - ctypes?
-   zarith - contains c code and needs libgmp-dev, perl
-   async - ?
-   ctypes etc.
-   something depends on libffi, I forget what. ctypes?
-   perl - needed by zarith
-   etc.
