caching
=======

[Remote
caching](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/remote-caching.html) -
"A remote cache is used by a team of developers and/or a continuous
integration (CI) system to share build outputs. If your build is
reproducible, the outputs from one machine can be safely reused on
another machine, which can make builds significantly faster."
