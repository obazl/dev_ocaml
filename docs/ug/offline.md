offline development
===================

[Fetching external
dependencies](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/0.28.0/guide.html#fetch)
- "By default, Bazel will download and symlink external dependencies
during the build. However, this can be undesirable, either because you'd
like to know when new external dependendencies are added or because
you'd like to 'prefetch' dependencies (say, before a flight where you'll
be offline)."
