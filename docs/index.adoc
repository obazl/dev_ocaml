This site documents the OBazl toolsuite, version 2.

// The OBazl rules
// are deliberately low-level, in keeping with the goal of giving the
// developer complete control (i.e. no magic). Obazl build rules
// correspond more-or-less directly to the build commands they construct.
// The down side of sugar-free rules is a degree of inconvenience. For
// example, OBazl does not analyze implicit dependencies, so it is the
// responsibility of the developer to discover and list them. It does not
// support file globbing, so each source file must have a build rule.
// Most such inconveniences can and will be addressed over time by
// tooling built on the foundation of the primitive rules.
