Official docs:

* link:https://bazel.build/concepts/build-ref["Workspaces, packages, and targets",window="_blank"]

OBazl deviates somewhat from the official documentation in order to
fill in some of the holes and resolve some ambiguities. We think the
official docs routinely conflate distinct concepts like "workspace"
and "repository" and are often inconsistent and/or confusing.

* link:https://bazel.build/concepts/build-ref#workspace[Workspace,window="_blank"]:  the docs say "A workspace is a directory tree on your filesystem...". OBazl reserves "repository" for this meaning and restricts the meaning of "workspace" to the namespace determined by a WORKSPACE file as described below.

* link:https://bazel.build/concepts/build-ref#repositories[Repositories,window="_blank"]: "Code is organized in repositories. The directory containing the WORKSPACE file is the root of the main repository, also called @. Other, (external) repositories are defined in the WORKSPACE file using workspace rules."

This language is unclear and inconsistent to us. For example, `@`
names a workspace, not a repository; and it is critical to maintain
the distinction between a repository (a filesystem object) and a
workspace (a namespace that is *_not_* the same thing as the
repository associated with it).

== Terminology

* WORKSPACE (or just WS) file: file named WORKSPACE.bazel
** Bazel also accepts WORKSPACE but OBazl conventions recommend WORKSPACE.bazel.
* Repository: a directory (tree) in a file system rooted at a directory containing a WS file (the "root WS file").
* Repository scope: the entire subtree?
* Workspace: a namespace, determined by a WS file; overlaid on repository tree
* Workspace repository: the repository determined by the WS file. I.e.
  the repository associated with the WS. The repository of a workspace
  is its "underlying filesystem tree".
** Every workspace is associated with the repository rooted at the WS
   directory; this is called the "workspace repository"
* Workspace scope - see below
* worskpace directory: a directory containing a WS file
* BUILD file: a file named BUILD.bazel
** Bazel also accepts filename BUILD, but OBazl recommends BUILD.bazel
* package directory: a directory (within the scope of a workspace) containing a BUILD file
* Module: see ...

IMPORTANT: It follows that "repository" is not synonymous with
"workspace". A repository may contain file system objects that are not
within the scope of its associated workspace: there is a difference
between a file system object and the "space" determined by a WS file.
A workspace is a namespace; it contains names, not directories, files,
etc., and does not necessarily include every filesystem object in its
repository. So "workspace" means the namespace determined by a WS
file.

IOW we have two conceptual spaces: one for the file system, and one
for the "space" of Bazel entities such as packages and targets.


Each WS file determines exactly one workspace.

The _potential_ scope of the workspace determined by a WORKSPACE file
encompasses the directory that contains it and the entire
tree of subdirectories rooted at that directory - i.e. its repository.

A directory within the scope of a workspace that contains a BUILD file
is a (Bazel) _package directory_.

The _effective_ scope of a workspace is limited to the subset of
directories in its repository that

* are NOT within the scope of a workspace repository rooted at a subdirectory in the repository
** i.e. the effective scope excludes subtrees whose root directory contains a WS file
* DO contain a BUILD file (i.e. package directories)

WARNING: Subdirectories within a WS repository that contain a WS file
are *_not_* subworkspaces. Workspaces are not hierarchical; the
workspace/namespace determined by the WS file does not contain any WS names.

The name of the workspace is determined by the "workspace" function in
the WORKSPACE file if it is used (e.g. `workspace(name="foo")`;
otherwise it is the name of the directory containing the WORKSPACE
file.

== External Repositories and their Workspaces

A WORKSPACE file may contain Starlark code declaring and/or defining
_external_ workspaces, thereby "importing" their contents and making
them accessible by targets defined within the scope of declaring
workspace, i.e. packages and targets in the workspace may use the
external workspaces.

NOTE: External workspace declarations and definitions need not be
directly contained in the root WS file; they may also be
declared/defined by functions in extension files, so long as they are
loaded and called from the root WS file. A common pattern recommended
by OBazl conventions is to define a function in file `WORKSPACE.bzl`
(note the suffix: `.bzl`, not `.bazel`; this makes it an "extension"
file) that is responsible for "calling" rules to create external
workspaces, and then to load and call this function from the
`WORKSPACE.bazel` file.

An external workspace, relative to a "current" or "controlling"
 workspace, is a workspace whose repository is outside of the scope of
 the current workspace.

NOTE: This does not mean outside of the _repository_ of the current
workspace. If a repository contains subdirectories containing WS
files, the trees rooted at those subdirectories are inside of the
current repository but outside of the corrent workspace.

TODO: diagram

NOTE: This means that workspaces defined under a repository (within
the scope of the declaring WS) _may_ be declared as external
workspaces (using rule `local_repository`), but they can also be
ignored.

External workspaces may be local or remote.

* Local external workspaces are defined by repositories in the local
  filesystem, that are managed by the user. Recall that a repository
  by definition contains a WS file in its root directory.

** Local workspaces are declared using native rules `local_repository`
   and `new_local_repository`

** The workspace name of local external repositories is determined by
   the `name` attribute of the declaring rule.

* Remote external workspaces are defined by repositories in the local
  filesystem that are managed by Bazel.

** They are declared by Starlark repository rules, usually
  `http_archive` or `git_repository`. Bazel downloads the source and
  unpacks it in the local filesystem to form the repository.

** Such remote repositories typically contain a WORKSPACE file, but
   Bazel does not evaluate it, so any external workspaces that _it_
   declares will not be automatically imported. The new `bzlmod`
   facility was designed to address this shortcoming but it will not
   be supported by OBazl until version 3.

** The name attribute of the repo rule determines the workspace name.
Bazel will download and unpack the remote repo into a directory of
that name.

* User-defined repository rules may create local repositories from
  either local or remote resources. That is, they may create local
  repositories by creating/copying/symlinking artifacts in the local
  filesystem or by downloading them.

CAUTION: When building with remote caching and/or executation,
locations may be on other machines. TODO: articulate this.

Once a workspace is declared and defined, the location of its
underlying repository in the file system is invisible to starlark code
that references it.


So repositories contain (in addition to the root WORKSPACE file)
BUILD.bazel files, .bzl extension files, source files etc., but not
(strictly speaking) packages or targets. Workspaces contain Bazel
packages and targets (i.e. labels), the variables and functions
defined in extension files (what else?), but not directories or files.
Note that source file names do double duty: they are contained as
filenames in the repository, and as target names in the namespace.

== MODULES

Bazel module definition: "A module is essentially a Bazel project that
can have multiple versions..." This is useless since "Bazel project"
is undefined.

"The MODULE.bazel file should be located at the root of the workspace
directory (next to the WORKSPACE file)."

Regarding module dependencies: "In your workspace, each module then
gets turned into a repo."

The MODULE.bazel file specifies dependencies, but does not use
repository rules to do so. I.e. it specifies module deps, not
repository deps. The specified module (name plus version) is resolved
by a Bazel registry, which contains the metadata Bazel needs to figure
out hhow to obtain the repository. Note that this mechanism does not
use repository rules.

That is, each module is associated with repository, and thus a
namespace (repositories must contain a WORKSPACE file). But the
namespace is determined by the module(name=...) function (contained in
the MODULE.bazel file of the repository) rather than a repo rule or
the WORKSPACE file.

Q: what if the WORKSPACE file contains a workspace(name=...) that does
not match the module name?

Q: what if the module name in a downloaded MODULE.bazel file does not
match the name used in bazel_dep(name=...)? (Presumably the registry
would prevent this from happening?)

Q: can we have both repo rules in WORKSPACE.bazel and bazel_dep rules
in MODULE.bazel?

So MODULE.bazel gives us the module name, and that serves as the
namespace name.

ALIASES

The local_repository and new_local_repository rules support the
repo_mapping attribute that defines aliasing.

The 'bind' repo rule, although "not recommended", can also define aliases.

Q: can aliasing affect module naming? The repository associated with a
module could have local repos, no? But aliasing is scoped.

================================================================

"Repository Rules" https://bazel.build/rules/repository_rules

This section covers user-defined repo rules.

"An external repository is a rule ...".  Sigh.

"Each external repository rule creates its own workspace, with its own BUILD files and artifacts..."

The implementation of a repo rule "describe[s] how to create the
repository, its content and BUILD files."

Bazel-defined repo rules are called "workspace rules".

"Workspace Rules" https://bazel.build/reference/be/workspace

"Native":

* local_repository - "Allows targets from a local directory to be bound..." This seems to mean "local directory configured as a repo" or something like that.
* new_local_repository - "Allows a local directory to be turned into a Bazel repository..."

"Starlark" repo rules:

Git repository rules https://bazel.build/rules/lib/repo/git:

* git_repository - "Clone an external git repository..."
* new_git_repository - "Clone an external git repository..."

Http repository rules:

* http_archive - "Downloads a Bazel repository..."
* http_file
* http_jar
