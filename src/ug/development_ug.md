# Developing OCaml software with OBazl

## Prerequisites

* Platform: Linux or MacOS. Both Bazel and OCaml support windows, so
  OBazl may work, but it has not been tested and there are no plans to
  do so. However, it should not be terribly difficult to port it to
  Windows. If you have the time and energy to work on this please
  reach out on the [OBazl Discord
  server](https://discord.gg/PHSAW5DUva) and I will be happy to help.
